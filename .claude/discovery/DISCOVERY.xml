  <!-- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -->
  <executive-summary>
    <one-liner>Daily check-in game for Solana Seeker where missing one day means losing everything</one-liner>
    <problem>Seeker users need organic daily transactions for SKR Wave 2 farming but have no fun reason to transact</problem>
    <solution-vision>Gamify daily transactions with real stakes - stake SOL, check in daily to grow, miss once and lose it all</solution-vision>
    <success-metric>10,000 active users generating 6-10 organic transactions daily</success-metric>
    <timeline>3 days to launch on Seeker dApp Store</timeline>
  </executive-summary>

  <!-- PROBLEM SPACE -->
  <problem-space>
    <problem-statement>
      <description>SKR Wave 1 distributed only 20% of supply based on on-chain activity tiers. Wave 2 is coming with another 10%+ allocation. Seeker users are ranked by transaction volume and activity. Currently users resort to wash trading or forcing themselves to use random apps with no intrinsic motivation.</description>
      <root-cause>No engaging reason to transact daily on Seeker - activity feels like a chore rather than entertainment</root-cause>
      <impact>Users either game the system poorly (wash trading) or miss out on significant SKR allocations worth thousands of dollars</impact>
      <urgency level="critical">Seeker Season 2 is live NOW. Wave 2 timing unknown but activity is being tracked. Every day without organic transactions is lost farming potential.</urgency>
    </problem-statement>

    <current-state>
      <existing-solution>Wash trading between own wallets, forcing usage of random dApps, or simply not farming optimally</existing-solution>
      <pain-points>
        <pain>Wash trading feels pointless and may not count for rankings</pain>
        <pain>Using random apps provides no entertainment value</pain>
        <pain>No social element to make farming fun</pain>
        <pain>Easy to forget to transact daily</pain>
      </pain-points>
      <what-works>Users already have Seed Vault habit - fingerprint to confirm is natural</what-works>
